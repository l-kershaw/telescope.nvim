PR: https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/pull/823

A lot of new and breaking changes here as we work to clean up the way users
can configure how telescope's windows are configured.

|telescope.setup()| has changed `layout_defaults` -> `layout_config`.
    This makes it so that the setup and the pickers share the same key,
    otherwise it is too confusing which key is for which.


`picker:find()` now has different values available for configuring the UI.
    All configuration for the layout must be passed in the key:
        `layout_config`.

    Previously, these keys were passed via `picker:find(opts)`, but should be
    passed via `opts.layout_config` now.
        - {height}
        - {width}

    These keys are removed:
        - {results_height}: This key is no longer valid. Instead, use `height`
          and the corresponding `preivew_*` options for the layout strategy to
          get the correct results height. This simplifies the configuration
          for many of the existing strategies.

    You should get error messages when you try and use any of the above keys now.
